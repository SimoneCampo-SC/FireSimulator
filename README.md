# FireSimulator
The project aims to develop a console-based fire simulation in Object Oriented C++, which presents a 2D forest of 21x21 grid of cells containing the state of trees (&, @) surrounded by the boundary (0).
During each time step, some trees burn according to certain condition defined in Section 1.2 and the simulation finishes when either there are no more burning trees in the forest or when the user wants to get out. At the end, the fire simulator statistics are displayed
